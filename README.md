# AQI_Forecasting
🌫️ AQI Forecasting Using Python & Pandas
This project involves analyzing and preprocessing air quality data to forecast Air Quality Index (AQI) levels. It uses Python, the pandas library for data manipulation, and includes essential steps like handling missing data, converting date/time formats, and preparing the dataset for potential modeling or visualization.

📁 Project Summary
Dataset: Contains air quality measurements including PM2.5, PM10, NO2, etc., recorded along with date and time.

Goal: Prepare and clean the dataset for accurate AQI forecasting or visualization.

Notebook: All steps are performed and documented in a Jupyter Notebook.

✅ Features
Converts date from DD/MM/YYYY to standard YYYY-MM-DD format.

Converts time strings to datetime.time objects.

Handles missing values (NaN) in numerical columns.

Calculates the mean of all numeric columns safely.

Selects only numeric data for aggregation and analysis.

Prepares data for future forecasting models or visualization tools.

🧠 Libraries Used
pandas

numpy

(optional) matplotlib, seaborn for future visualization

⚙️ Getting Started
Clone this repo or upload the notebook to your environment.

Ensure the dataset CSV is available and paths are correctly set.

Run through the cells to clean and process the data.

📝 Notes
Missing values are handled using mean imputation.

Date/time conversions are done carefully to avoid errors with misinterpreted formats.

Designed to be used as a starting point for building time series models or dashboards.
